Version 1.0.2 (2014-11-18)
==========================

* Bugfix: An error was shown when a translation file (Gambit_XX.qm)
  didn't exist, even if that file never should have existed in the
  first place.

Version 1.0.1 (2014-10-27)
==========================

* Building from a source tarball/archive/package failed due to a
  source code control system directory (like '.svn' or '.git')
  being missing. Such a directory was being used to generate a
  revision number header file (.h), so the revision number can be
  displayed in the About box.
  Source archives will now include such a generated revision number
  header, so it doesn't need to be generated.

Version 1.0 (2014-09-27)
========================

* First version.
