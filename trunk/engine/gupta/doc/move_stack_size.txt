This document explains how the maximum size for the move stack (for move generation) can be
calculated. The calculation is very simple and yields a number that theoretically is too high, but
that doesn't matter. Better to have a simple, reliable calculation, instead of a possibly buggy one
or one of which it is hard to prove the correctness of.

Maximum number of moves for a queen:
    27 moves (from one of the 4 center squares, 7 in 3 directions, 6 in the other)

Maximum number of moves for a rook:
    14 moves

Maximum number of moves for a bishop:
    13 moves (from one of the 4 center squares, 7 in 1 direction, 6 in the other)

Maximum number of moves for a knight:
    8 moves

Maximum number of moves for a king:
    10 moves (1 in all directions, 2 castling moves)

Special moves to account for:
    - Castling kingside, castling queenside.
(En Passant is omitted from the list on purpose, see below for the reason.)

When we treat all pawns as queens, one side can at maximum have the following pieces:
    - 9 queens
    - 2 rooks
    - 2 bishops
    - 2 knights
    - 1 king

The special move En Passant doesn't have to be accounted for, and to say that, we don't even have
to compare the maximum number of moves a pawn can make with the maximum number of moves a queen can
make, because a pawn can't move backwards, and a queen can, so that move already covers the En
Passant move.

The pieces in the list above can generate the most number of moves, and here's how many:
    323 = 9 (queens) * 27 +
          2 (rooks) * 14 +
          2 (bishops) * 13 +
          2 (knights) * 8 +
          1 (king) * 10

So for a maximum search depth of 8, the move stack used by the move generator should be at least
'2584 = 323 * 8' elements in size. One can then easily index this move stack using the current
height of the game tree (remember, it changes while the search algorithm is executing) to get the
first element for that height (to store the moves that are going to be generated, or to enumerate
the moves generated for that height).
